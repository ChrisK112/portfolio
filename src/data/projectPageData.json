        "A third person shooter with a 2D art style and randomly generated levels. Made in Unity, with certain assets made in Blender, as part of a third year module. The project was an exciting undertaking, which helped broaden expertise in C# and an gave exposure to new programs. The game was a quarter year undertaking in which all aspects of game development had to be carried out. This included looking for, creating and editing assets: animations, models, textures, sounds and music, etc. while also working with the Unity game engine.\n\n The final game was a run and gun third person shooter, where the player is dropped into a randomnly generated dungeon, filled with monsters, pickups, and a final boss.

A group project that focused on the use of Preact - a lightweight version of React -  to create a weather reporting application with customisable features for iPhones. The app used an API to gather weather datafor the userâ€™s area using geolocation, then processed all relevant information to display onits main page. The application was customisable, from its text to background, and evenchanged theme based on current weather.This project was a great opportunity to expand current knowledge of CSS, and was a goodintroduction to working with Preact, which is very nearly identical to React. The project was a learning experience and an introduction to Git and its helpful features, it also helped to improve skills relating to working in a team, especially organisation and communication.",

Collected participant data had to be handled in accordance to data protection laws.Working on the project was an enjoyable experience, which provided a great opportunity to learn to use a game engine, experience working in a new programming language, and develop expertise in an already known one.
