                    Hi, my name is Krzysztof! I am a graduate  of Computer Science, and hope to soon join the industry profesionally.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    With experience I have gained from numerous projects in and outside my studies, and passion to learn new and 
                    engaging technologies, I hope to become an asset to any team I joins. My time at university introduced me to many 
                    programming languages, but my most developed one would have to be Java, although I work with many, for many
                    different projects. Having always had an interest in the technology and software development industry, I was keen 
                    to get an opportunity that leads to a path joining it. 
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I would have to describe myself as a reserved and independent person that tries to keep friendly relations with everyone.
                    I give my best to solve any problem thrown at me, through the many avenues I learned to utilise over the years he 
                    studied programming. I'm always eager to learn new skills that will ultimately help him become a better software 
                    engineer.
